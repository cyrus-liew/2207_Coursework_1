# 2207 Coursework 1

Coursework 1 is a team project, where you develop a mobile application capable of
exfiltrating contents from the mobile phone and hiding the malicious intent using
smart algorithms to prevent the reverse engineering of Android APK. You will be
evaluated based on the following three parts of the coursework.

**Part 1**:
Design a basic Android application that does the following
1. Display the name of the Team members
2. Detailed information on each team member when clicked on their name
Make sure you have an intuitive self-contained application design.

**Part 2**:
Spy-friendly version of your application.
1. Modify the application to perform at least one malicious activity
2. Gather and exfiltrate information from the mobile phone
3. Malicious activity should be stealthy and not evident to a common user
4. Example: reading SMS, copying images, and sending it to a remote
destination.
Creativity is the key to getting additional points in this section.

**Part 3**:
Make analysis harder
1. Obfuscate/Hide the malicious intent of the program so that it is hard for an
analyst
2. You can use obfuscation tools or design custom-made obscuring algorithms

**Submission**
The team should give a presentation and demo of their application before the 10th
of February 2023. Presentations will be scheduled during the 3rd and 10th February
lab hours (Weeks 5 and 6). The code should be uploaded in LMS with proper
documentation and a project report by 17th February 2023.
